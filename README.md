# onesAndZeros3
This challenge is based on onesAndZeros2, instead of having only ones and zeros, now you will be given an array of different intergers and each time, you will still choose any three consecutive elements of the same value and remove them from the array until there is no such three elements left .What is the minimum length of the array that can remain after applying  the described operation several times?


NOTE: Try to solve this in O(n), any solutions having passed by finding and removing a triple each time is just lucky because they run in O(n ** 2) !
